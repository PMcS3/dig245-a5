      <h2> Task 1: Find where you live </h2>
      <p> Time: 1 minute <br>
          I asked my Dad to locate home on google maps and narrate his process. He immediately identified a landmark on the map screen and started to drag down with the cursor, manipulating the map view. Recognizing where this view put him geographically, he decided to change the scope of the map. He found the (+/-) buttom in the bottom righthand corner and used it to zoom in and out on the map.
`         Using this process of identifying landmarks, adjusting the scape of the map, and triangulating his location, he was successful in finding our house. After, he noted that, "normally I would use the search bar." He seemed frustrated in realizing he could have used the search bar (and typed in our address) feature instead of dragging through the map. It is safe to say that, if he did this task again, he would use the search bar to locate our address on the map.

      <h2> Task 2: Find the address of a restaurant of a restaurant you like </h2>
      <p> Time: 20 seconds <br>
          For this task, he selected the search bar to search for the name of the restaurant. He did not notice the drop down suggestions on the search bar, and simply pressed enter once he typed in the restaurant name. He then moved his cursor over and clicked on the spot where the restaurant is pinned on the map screen. He had assumed a pin on the map screen would reveal the address when clicked. Upon realizing this didn't prompt a change on the page, he directed his attention to the sidebar on the left side of the screen, where the address is listed. He seemed pleased with being able to find this information quickly and easily.

      <h2> Task 3: View this restaurant in street view </h2>
      <p> Time: ~2 minutes <br>
          Unsure how to begin at first, my Dad typed in the name of the restaurant into the search bar. From here, he was unsure how to access street view (a function he was familiar with, but had not used recently). The feature is not marked by name. He first attempted to find the street view function by selecting the satellite map view displayed in bottom left corner of the map, only to realize its function. He then shifted his attention to the right corner of the map screen, and recognized the little yellow man icon. He quickly clicked and dragged the yellow man 6 or 7 times before he realized he needed to change his approach; dragging and dropping quickly, he was not able to land the yellow man icon near the pin for the restaurant. He gradually noticed that blue lines would appear on the streets in the map view. He got frustrated by not being able to drag to a spot in front of the restaurant. Eventually, he dropped the icon right on the pin and was able to view the inside of the restaurant.

      <h2> Task 4: Find out how long it would take for you to drive to this restaurant </h2>
      <p> Time: 5 seconds <br>
          This task was very intuitive. Because he was already viewing the information banner for the restaurant, my Dad easily found the blue arrow button labeled "directions" and clicked it. Immediately directions and a time estimate appeared on the sidebar. He quickly reported that it would take 5 minutes to drive from our current location to the restaurant. </p>

    <div class = "task">
      <h2> Task 5: Add this restautant to your "favorites" list</h2>
      <p> Time: 1.5 minutes <br>
          This was the first task that my Dad was completely unfamiliar with. He first found the menu icon, located on the top right corner
          of the sidebar, directly next to the searchbar. He then scanned the 16 menu options, and, after a beat, clicked on the "my places" option with a location pin icon. If I were to conduct this test again, I would change my wording to "save" it to your favorites list, rather than "add."
